        As a 25 years old guy, there's a lot for me to achieve. Many things I
        don't know; zero of them I can't learn. Nothing beats consistent effort,
        paired with elevated motivation and intention.

        In the early days of my Computer Science studies, I've landed my first
        intership. The rest is history; I'm still working, craving for endless
        opportunities. Here's a short summary of my working experience:

        This website was designed and build from scratch completely by myself. I
        love ReactJS so much that I used it here, even though it's not a perfect
        solution for this. Check out the source code if you're interested.

      <H6>
        Besides JS, I adore HTML/CSS (yes, I've just said that); and I also have
        experience with Java, Ruby, and design tools. On the non-technical side,
        I was involved in Product Management, Sales, Business Management, and
        Rebranding.

        I like to fill my free time with photography, sports, writing, and
        reading. Most of the time backed up with electronic music.
